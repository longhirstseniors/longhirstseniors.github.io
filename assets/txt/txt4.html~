<!-- do not alter this header unless confident in what you are doing-->
<link href="txt-black.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<!--
href= can ge one of the following:
"txt.css"               default black text
"txt-yellow.css"        yellow text
"txt-white.css"         white text
"txt-black.css"         black text
"txt-blue.css"         blue text
-->
<!--

Multiple spaces are ignored After the 1st one but can be implemented as &nbsp;&nbsp; etc
eg.
        2 spaces&nbsp;&nbsp;then text
or
        10 spaces&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then text

Insert an empty line with <br>
eg.
        <br>
        this is a new line
        this is still on the same line
        <br>
        a new line is forced by above

A paragraph is enclosed by <p> and </p> but often only the starting <p> is needed
eg.
        <p>
        a first new paragraph
        </p>
        <p>
        a second new paragraph
        </p>
or        
        <p>
        a first new paragraph
        <p>
        a second new paragraph
        

Text is emboldened by surrounding it with <b> and </b> tags
eg
        this text is normal, <b>this is bold</b>


example:


<p>

        Golf courses and driving ranges must close with immediate effect.

        We will issue a full statement on Wednesday.

        <br>
                <b>NO PLAY TUESDAY.</b>
        <br>
 
</p>


or a simpler example:


Golf courses are still closed. We will review when appropriate.
