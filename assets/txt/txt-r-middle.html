<!-- do not alter this header unless confident in what you are doing-->
<link href="txt-yellow.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<!--
href= can ge one of the following:
"txt.css"               default black text
"txt-yellow.css"        yellow text
"txt-white.css"         white text
"txt-black.css"         black text
"txt-blue.css"         blue text
-->
<!--

Multiple spaces are ignored After the 1st one but can be implemented as &nbsp;&nbsp; etc
eg.
        2 spaces&nbsp;&nbsp;then text
or
        10 spaces&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then text

Insert an empty line with <br>
eg.
        <br>
        this is a new line
        this is still on the same line
        <br>
        a new line is forced by above

A paragraph is enclosed by <p> and </p> but often only the starting <p> is needed
eg.
        <p>
        a first new paragraph
        </p>
        <p>
        a second new paragraph
        </p>
or        
        <p>
        a first new paragraph
        <p>
        a second new paragraph
        

Text is emboldened by surrounding it with <b> and </b> tags
eg
        this text is normal, <b>this is bold</b>


example:


<p>

        Golf courses and driving ranges must close with immediate effect.

        We will issue a full statement on Wednesday.

        <br>
                <b>NO PLAY TUESDAY.</b>
        <br>
 
</p>


or a simpler example:


Golf courses are still closed. We will review when appropriate.

                            Following this afternoons tier 4 announcement, we will be implementing a 2 ball only policy from tommorow. In order for us to have as many members play as possible, we will not be allowing visitors or guests.
                            For any pre booked times, we would kindly ask if you could arrange your tee times accordingly with members only. We will monitor the tee sheet over the coming days. It will save having to wipe the current tee sheet of your pre booked times.
                            If there time available on the day, we may allow vistors/guests to use these slots.
                            More importantly, please cancel any times that you can not make, as they will incur a Â£25 charge, and allow more members to play.
                            More updates as we recieve them.
                            <br></br>
                            Best
                            Graham
                            <br></br>
