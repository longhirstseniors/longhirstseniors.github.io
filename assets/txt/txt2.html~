<!-- do not alter this header unless confident in what you are doing-->
<link href="txt-blue.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<!--
href= can ge one of the following:
"txt.css"               default black text
"txt-yellow.css"        yellow text
"txt-white.css"         white text
"txt-black.css"         black text
-->
<!--

Multiple spaces are ignored After the 1st one but can be implemented as &nbsp;&nbsp; etc
eg.
        2 spaces&nbsp;&nbsp;then text
or
        10 spaces&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then text

Insert an empty line with <br>
eg.
        <br>
        this is a new line
        this is still on the same line
        <br>
        a new line is forced by above

A paragraph is enclosed by <p> and </p> but often only the starting <p> is needed
eg.
        <p>
        a first new paragraph
        </p>
        <p>
        a second new paragraph
        </p>
or        
        <p>
        a first new paragraph
        <p>
        a second new paragraph
        

Text is emboldened by surrounding it with <b> and </b> tags
eg
        this text is normal, <b>this is bold</b>


example:


<p>

        Golf courses and driving ranges must close with immediate effect.

        We will issue a full statement on Wednesday.

        <br>
                <b>NO PLAY TUESDAY.</b>
        <br>
 
</p>


or a simpler example:


Golf courses are still closed. We will review when appropriate.

Wednesday 12th December
<br>
                            Following the government tier announcment, we are to remain in tier 3, therefore its golf and driving range only. There will be no services from the clubhouse, with the exception of golf reception and toilets.
                            <br></br>
                            It's a sad time that we can't share the festive spirit in the clubhouse, but rest assured, when we can, we will be going all out to make up for lost time. Keep
                            To add to that, as we have had a recent busy spell preceded by a lockdown, we have opened the tee sheet for boxing day AND new years day.
                            The tee sheet will be available this afternoon.
                            Hope to see you on the course over the festive period.
                            <br></br>
                            Best
                            Graham.
                            <br></br>
